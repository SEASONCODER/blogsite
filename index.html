    <h3>Introduction to Criminology Theories</h3>
    <p>Criminology, the study of crime, criminal behavior, and the criminal justice system, is a field rich with diverse theories that attempt to explain why crimes occur. Understanding these theories provides insight into the various factors that influence criminal behavior and can inform strategies for prevention and intervention. Hereâ€™s a brief introduction to some of the foundational criminology theories:</p>
    <h3>Classical Criminology</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Rational Choice Theory:</strong> This theory posits that individuals commit crimes based on a rational calculation of the costs and benefits. If the benefits outweigh the risks, they are more likely to engage in criminal behavior.<p>
           <p> 
            <strong>Deterrence Theory:</strong> Based on the idea that the threat of punishment can deter individuals from committing crimes. It emphasizes the importance of swift, certain, and severe punishment to prevent crime.</p>
